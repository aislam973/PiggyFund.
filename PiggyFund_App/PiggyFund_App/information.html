              <h2>Equities</h2>
              <p>Invest in equities- stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs which has high return and is less risky.

In addition, you should find the lowest expense ratio (the amount of the fund's assets that are used for administative and operating expenses) on your mutual funds or ETF </p>
